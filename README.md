# AI-based tagging of a scanned photos collection
This project uses a graph-based method to organize personal photo collections. Images are analyzed using AI to extract faces, metadata, and descriptions. Similar images are linked in a graph. Central photos are tagged manually, and tags are spread across the network to reduce effort while maximizing organization.
